# Quick Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your invoice app running:

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Set Up Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

**What this does:**

- Opens browser for GitHub authentication
- Creates a new Convex project
- Generates `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
- Starts the Convex development server
- Keep this terminal window open!

## 3. Set Up Clerk Authentication

### Create Clerk Account

1. Go to https://clerk.com and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Choose "Email" and "Google" (or your preferred providers)

### Get Your API Keys

1. In Clerk dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Copy the keys and add to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### Configure Clerk with Convex

1. In Clerk dashboard, go to **JWT Templates**
2. Create a new template named "convex"
3. Copy the **Issuer URL** (looks like: `https://your-app.clerk.accounts.dev`)
4. Go to Convex dashboard at https://dashboard.convex.dev
5. Navigate to **Settings** → **Authentication**
6. Click **Add Authentication Provider**
7. Select **Clerk**
8. Paste your Clerk Issuer URL
9. Save

## 4. Start the App

Open a new terminal window (keep `npx convex dev` running):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 5. Open Your Browser

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Your `.env.local` Should Look Like This:

```env
# Convex (auto-generated by npx convex dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Clerk (from Clerk dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Clerk URLs (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Convex client not configured"

- Make sure `npx convex dev` is running
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is in `.env.local`
- Restart your Next.js dev server

### "Clerk authentication failed"

- Verify both Clerk keys are in `.env.local`
- Make sure you configured Clerk in Convex dashboard
- Check that the Issuer URL matches exactly

### "Cannot find module 'convex/react'"

- Run `npm install` again
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`

## Next Steps

1. **Sign up** for an account at http://localhost:3000/sign-up
2. **Create a client** from the Clients page
3. **Create your first invoice** from the Dashboard or Invoices page
4. **Open multiple browser windows** to see real-time sync in action!

## Development Workflow
